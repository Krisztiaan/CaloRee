# CaloRee
User provides age, gender, weight and daily calorie intake
through a formula it gives back 3 possible results: exceeded calorie limit, exactly the ideal intake, or less, than ideal
age, gender and weight are supposed to be saved with SharedPreferences, but in a way it's still editable 
Splash Activity makes sure, that the user doesn't have to provide username on each login
